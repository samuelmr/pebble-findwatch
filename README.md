Locate your lost Pebble smart watch!

If you have your phone available and the Pebble smart watch is within
Bluetooth reach, you can use this Watch App to make the watch vibrate
and flash the screen so that it'll be easier for you to find.

Just install this Watch App and your pebble will start to vibrate and
flash. You can set how long the watch app will run. You can also turn
vibrations and flashes on and off.
